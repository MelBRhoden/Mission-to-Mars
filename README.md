# Mission-to-Mars

HTML Web scraping on Mars data to create a Flask web application using Python and MongoDB
# Overview
The mission with this project was to learn web scraping methods to extract information from the NASA Science Mars Exploration website using Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components, Beautiful Soup/Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scrape, MongoDB to store the data, and finally Flask to create a web application to display the data. Through the process, the goal was to develop an appt to scrape the following information about the planet Mars:
* Latest News
* Featured Image
* Facts about the planet
* Images of the hemispheres

The final product was a fully-functional web application creted with Flask that included images, a table with information about Mars in comparison to Earth, and the latest article title and short description scraped from the NASA's webpage. Each time we click on the "Scrape New Data" button new information will be updated on both the website and the MongoDB.
